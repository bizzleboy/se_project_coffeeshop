# Parker's Practicum Coffee Shop

We gonna get supercharged in this cool cafe. broh.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Need to have a connected database for accepting user reservations.
Would like to incorporate more animations (perhaps one that plays while user waits for coffee?)
add more gradients and incorporate a gradual fall from white to navy instead of just in footer
